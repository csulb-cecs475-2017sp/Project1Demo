# TO-DO

After GitHub duplicates this repository to one with "-yourname" at the end, follow these two steps:

1. Let Neal know that the repository has been set up, and wait for his reply before going on.
2. Either by cloning the repository to your computer and editing editing/commiting/pushing from there, or by directly editing via the GitHub web UI, edit the file `src/War/Deck.cs`on line 51 to change `Card.CardSuit.Hearts` to `Card.CardSuit.Clubs`. 
    
    When the change has been committed to GitHub, the test runner will execute your change with the private test case, which will fail. You will receive an email within 2-3 minutes (to the email associated with your GitHub account) detailing the failure.
    
3. Edit the same file, same line, so that `Card.CardSuit.Clubs` now reads `(Card.CardSuit)suit`. Commit to GitHub and wait for the new (passing) email.
